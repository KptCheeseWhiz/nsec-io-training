## Lab objective
In this lab we will make a copy of the GitHub repository for use in later labs. We will log on to the console and make sure we have the required access. We will familiarize with Bicep and try out our first deployment of the resource group.

It is important we do not delete the resource group as that will be used in later steps.

## Instructions
1. Log in to Github.com. Access the repository: UPDATE LINK
2. Follow the steps to import a repository: https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-github-importer/importing-a-repository-with-github-importer 
3. Log in to your Azure subscription.
4. Use the bicep template to deploy a resource group.

### Note:
A resource group does not have any cost, do not delete this resource group as it will be used in the subsequent labs.
